### Abstract

Soft prompting or prompt tuning refers to a parameter efficient tuning technique where the base LLM is frozen and a set of trainable embeddings are prepended to the input sequence. In this work, we demonstrate two findings. First (1): LLMs natively have a basic internal comprehension of soft prompts and are capable of verbalizing explanations of certain soft prompts in natural language, revealing activated concepts. Second (2): these verbalized explanations reveal how soft prompts can implicitly extract and utilize an LLM’s latent scientific knowledge. This indicates that soft prompting can act as a loosely "science informed" learning algorithm, capable of drawing upon the vast quantity of scientific literature ingested by LLMs during its pre-training to inform its predictions. 

### Command for reproducing experiments

Example Usage
`python -m run_experiment --experiment math_dataset_customv2 softprompt_generator_regression softprompt_verbalizer --save_directory ./datasets/<folder name>`

This will build the dataset, train the soft prompts, and generate verbalizations. In that order.
